# Python Principles Solutions
This repository contains my solutions for the programming exercises found on Python Principles. These exercises are great for anyone starting out with Python programming and want to enhance their skills.

## Contents
In the repository, each Python file is tied to a specific exercise. Please note that I've opted to use different filenames from those on Python Principles, as I found their naming conventions didn't provide sufficient clarity.

## Setup
No additional setup is required to run these files. The only requirement is that you have Python installed on your computer.

1. Clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/Liblis/python-principles-solutions`

2. Navigate to the directory:
`cd python-principles-solutions`

3. Run the Python file you're interested in:
`python filename.py`

## Contributing
This repository is intended to share my personal solutions to the exercises. As such, contributions are not currently needed or requested. Thank you for your interest.
